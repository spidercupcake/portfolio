# IDEA

**Basic layout**

- Basic homepage with Hero picture in center.
- Social media links on top right, set vertically.
- Name and Deccription under Hero picture.
- Technologies that I work on in the bottom, Glassmorphic div. Items zoom when hovered or touched.
- An Arrow " v " shows on bottom above the Technologies Div.
- Background image is lazily loaded with a gray placeholder and slowly fade into background.

**When Scrolled**

- Socials stay in its place.
- Everything starts moving upwards and fades on top.
- The bottom Technologies div extends from bottom.
- The arrow " v " turns into a line "\_\_" and extends vertically till it reaches the horizontal edges.
- The background image first zooms then starts to blur to match the bottom technologies div.
