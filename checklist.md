# IDEA

**Basic layout**

- [x] Basic homepage with Hero picture in center.
- [x] Social media links on top right, set vertically.
- [x] Name and Deccription under Hero picture.
- [x] Technologies that I work on in the bottom, Glassmorphic div. Items zoom when hovered or touched.
- [ ] An Arrow " v " shows on bottom above the Technologies Div.
- [x] Background image is lazily loaded with a zink placeholder and slowly fade into background.

**When Scrolled**

- [x] Socials stay in its place.
- [x] Everything starts moving upwards
- [ ] and fades on top.
- [x] The bottom Technologies div extends from bottom.
- [ ] The arrow " v " turns into a line "\_\_" and extends vertically till it reaches the horizontal edges.
- [x] The background image first zooms then starts to blur
- [ ] to match the bottom technologies div.
